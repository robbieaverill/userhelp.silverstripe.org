# userhelp.silverstripe.org

This is the source code powering https://userhelp.silverstripe.org.  It primarily
consists of the SilverStripe framework and the [docsviewer](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-docsviewer)
module with minimal configuration.

For adding functionality or editing the style of the documentation see the 
[docsviewer](http://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-docsviewer) module.

## Getting started
To set up a local development environment:

 1. Use a `_ss_environment.php` file to config your site.
 2. Clone this repository to a LAMP server.
 3. Install [Composer](http://userhelp.silverstripe.org/framework/en/installation/composer).
 4. Run `composer install` to install dependancies.
 5. Run BuildTask `.framework/sake dev/tasks/RefreshMarkdownTask flush=1`
 6. Make sure to flush the cache for markdown content to show up.

## Source Documentation Files

Documentation for each module is stored on the filesystem via a full git clone
of the module to the `assets/src/` subdirectory. These checkouts are ignored from this repository 
to allow for easier updating and to keep this project small. For the main documentation, a branch
 is used for each minor version of SilverStripe CMS.

To update or download the source documentation at any time run the following
BuildTask command with sake:

	cd /Sites/userhelp.silverstripe.org/
	sake dev/tasks/RefreshMarkdownTask flush=1

This build task will download / update each module as listed
in the `app/_config/docs-repositories.yml` file. Running `sake dev/tasks/RebuildLuceneDocsIndex flush=1` will then create a search index and reindex the documentation 
to facilitate searching.

Once the build task has executed and downloaded the latest files,
those files are registered along with the module version the folder relates to
through the `app/_config/docsviewer.yml` file.

```yaml
DocumentationManifest:
  register_entities:
    -
      Path: "assets/src/userhelp_3.2/docs/"
      Title: "User Help"
      VersionTitle: "3.x"
      Version: "3.2"
      Stable: true
      DefaultEntity: true
```

Set `Stable: true` on the set of documentation relating the current stable major version of SilverStripe CMS. Set `Archived: true` for all other versions than the current major version.


## Contribution

To contribute an improvement to the userhelp.silverstripe.org functionality or
theme, submit a pull request on GitHub. Any approved pull requests will make
their way onto the userhelp.silverstripe.org site in the next release.

The content for userhelp.silverstripe.org is stored in a separate repository:
[silverstripe/silverstripe-userhelp-content](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userhelp-content). 
If you wish to edit the documentation content, submit a pull request to that Github project. Updates 
to the content are synced regularly with userhelp.silverstripe.org via the cron job `UpdateDocsCronTask`.

## Cron job

The cron job `UpdateDocsCronTask` includes tasks that fetch the latest documentation for each module from git and rebuilds the search indexes.

```php
public function getSchedule()
{
    return '0 8 * * *'; // runs process() function every day at 8AM
}

## Deployment

Deployment is via the SilverStripe Platform deployment tool and uses StackShare.
